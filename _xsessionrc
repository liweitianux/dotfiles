# ~/.xsessionrc
#
# Some display managers (e.g., lightdm) do NOT source ~/.profile
# or ~/.xprofile, but some other display managers do.  Therefore,
# it is better to use this ~/.xsessionrc to do the initializations,
# as it will be *sourced* by Xsession(5), making the results more
# consistent among different display managers.
#
# See Xsession(5) for more details.
